To add a new vulnerability analysis in WAVE:

1. Add the code in WAVE.pl for performing that attack.
2. Add the code in parseconfig.pm for that attack name.
3. add the attack name in configuration.txt



Thanks Vaibhav. I read through the design and the plan as well as the Mindmap. Did not look at the code in detail. Will look at it later. Here are a few things I wanted to discuss briefly. It will take 5 minutes of your time. I'll call you soon.

Here are the points:

1) design doc before code , not after
2) order of the design document as per ur code writing
3) code in svn
4) clarification of function writing, and naming convention
5) any major change in reporting

Cheers
Arvind
